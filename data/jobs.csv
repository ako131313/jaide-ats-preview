1000146668,Goodwin Procter LLP,"New York City, New York",Pro Bono Nonprofit Senior Attorney,"The Pro Bono Nonprofit Sr. Attorney plays an important role in supporting the firm’s Pro Bono Initiative, which supports a diverse array of charitable missions that strengthen the communities in which we live and work. By providing legal support to nonprofit organizations, the firm helps drive positive change and fosters innovation in the nonprofit sector. This work also creates meaningful opportunities for Goodwin attorneys to apply their legal skills to organizations and causes that are meaningful to them, supporting a culture of service, professional growth, and personal fulfillment. Nonprofit pro bono work expands transactional pro bono opportunities, encourages broad attorney engagement, and strengthens the firm’s ties to the communities it serves. Because much of the Firm’s pro bono work falls substantively under the aegis of the Tax Exempt Organizations (TEO) sub-group of the T&E/TEO Business Law Department (BLD) Legal Specialty Group, the Sr. Attorney will report to that group for substantive purposes, with the Pro Bono Committee having an oversight function with respect to the aspects of the role related to the development and expansion of pro bono opportunities for business law attorneys. The Sr. Attorney is responsible for supporting and expanding the firm’s pro bono work for nonprofit, tax-exempt organizations. This role focuses on onboarding nonprofit clients, managing matters for existing clients, and providing legal oversight and mentorship to business law attorneys engaged in nonprofit pro bono matters. The essential duties and responsibilities outlined below directly support the role’s mission to expand and strengthen the firm’s pro bono practice for tax-exempt organizations, with a particular focus on engaging and mentoring general business law attorneys while providing hands-on expertise for more complex matters. With a strong emphasis on risk management and professional development, the Sr. Attorney ensures excellent results for clients and meaningful opportunities for firm attorneys. A core aspect of the position is to actively engage and empower general business law attorneys in pro bono work, fostering broad attorney participation across the firm. Recognizing the complexity of certain matters, the Sr. Attorney must balance hands-on involvement in challenging client matters with mentoring and oversight responsibilities, dedicating approximately 70% of their time to guiding and supporting other attorneys (including business development activities), and 30% to direct client service. Key responsibilities include screening and onboarding nonprofit pro bono clients, providing substantive tax support and oversight for 501(c)(3) matters, serving as a resource for Goodwin attorneys, collaborating with the Knowledge Management team to maintain and enhance exempt organization forms, precedents, and resources, and engaging in business development activities to cultivate pro bono opportunities related to tax-exempt organizations. Success in this role requires not only deep expertise in tax-exempt organization law, sound judgment, and exceptional communication skills, but also the ability to be a skillful teacher and mentor. The Sr. Attorney must be able to discern which matters are appropriate for non-specialists and which require specialist involvement. Being a skillful teacher and guide, driven by a genuine desire to mentor junior attorneys and a willingness to empower others by relinquishing direct control, is essential not only for fostering confidence in less experienced attorneys, but also for building a sustainable and engaged pro bono nonprofit practice. In addition, the attorney must be highly organized, dependable, and adept at working both independently and collaboratively, with a proactive approach to addressing challenges and managing details. Strong people skills and the ability to interact effectively across all organizational levels, as well as with potential nonprofit pro bono clients, are essential, as is a commitment to client service, risk management, attorney professional development, and broad pro bono engagement. Strategic thinking is also critical, particularly in identifying and cultivating a group of firm attorneys interested in nonprofit work who can serve as future mentors and resources for their colleagues and building out the firm’s roster of nonprofit pro bono clients. As outlined above, this position reports to the TEO subgroup within the T&E/TEO Legal Specialty Group for substantive legal purposes and works in close partnership with the Pro Bono team.

Oversee risk management throughout the lifecycle of pro bono matters, including intake, matter opening, staffing transitions, and case closures. Design and implement staffing risk management policies and procedures in collaboration with the Pro Bono Team, the Pro Bono Committee, and other stakeholders. Provide Mentoring and Oversight: Engage, mentor, and oversee corporate attorneys working on nonprofit pro bono matters, offering substantive guidance, training, and support. Supervise pro bono matters for nonprofit, tax-exempt organizations to ensure excellent client outcomes and meaningful attorney development. Collaborate on and facilitate training programs, clinics, and events to build corporate and transactional skills and promote broad attorney participation. Serve as a resource for attorneys on engagement letters, co-counseling agreements, client management, and legal ethics. Offer “Office Hours” weekly for firm attorneys.

We bring technical sophistication, industry knowledge, commercial focus, and global coverage to our representation of project lenders and sponsors in nearly every industrial sector and geography. Tracing our roots to the representation of developers of independent power projects in the United States in the early 1980s, Latham continues to pioneer financing structures that shape the market. We regularly execute more than 100 project financings worth billions of dollars in aggregate every year, including many “deals of the year” in markets around the globe. At the outset of any project matter, we work with clients to uncover potential pitfalls in the proposed transaction and map out solutions to each one. Drawing on the experience and foresight of regulatory and industry-focused colleagues around the globe, we spot issues and opportunities, particularly related to energy transition, few others can see. This approach, paired with Latham’s vast global resources, allows us to efficiently drive the most complex project finance transactions to completion. Our experience also yields insight into what is at market, and helps us work with both lenders and sponsors to structure the transaction to provide maximum value and security. For sponsors, we know what similarly situated parties are able to achieve in the market, which allows us to structure transactions that are financeable with terms and conditions that provide ongoing value. For lenders, we position the transaction for successful syndication. By representing parties on both sides of the table, we fully understand all aspects of a deal and know how to find a middle path to deal execution.

ABOUT LATHAM & WATKINS

 Latham & Watkins is one of the world’s leading global law firms advising the businesses and institutions that drive the global economy. We are the market leaders in major financial and business centers globally and offer unmatched expertise and resources to help you grow from an intellectually curious self-starter into an exceptional lawyer. If you aspire to be the best, this is where you belong. 

ABOUT THE PRACTICE GROUP

 Latham’s Supreme Court & Appellate team consistently secures precedent-setting, high-stakes victories for clients before the US Supreme Court and federal and state courts of appeal. 

Our appellate team provides clients with insightful, powerful representation. Team members have served as high-ranking officials in the US Department of Justice, clerked for Supreme Court Justices and federal judges, and argued hundreds of cases before appellate courts. Notably, four of our appellate lawyers have served in positions in the Solicitor General’s office. Latham also boasts more than a dozen former Supreme Court clerks and 60+ former US Court of Appeals clerks from all 13 circuit courts. 

Our track record before the Supreme Court includes numerous precedent-setting victories, and we have an exceptional success rate in seeking and opposing certiorari on behalf of clients. We repeatedly prevail in litigation against the US government representing Fortune 100 corporations, state governments, leading educational institutions, and individuals — especially in cases raising novel or challenging questions of administrative law — and in addition to preparing petitions for certiorari, we regularly craft merits and amicus briefs. Five different lawyers have argued more than a dozen cases before the US Supreme Court in the last four terms, contributing to our impressive record of 100+ arguments presented by Latham lawyers before the Court since 2001. We remain attuned to the Court by working on highly consequential Supreme Court cases all year, every year across a wide range of industries and issues. 

The appellate team frequently handles complex litigation and dispositive motions in the lower courts and before regulatory agencies. Latham’s hallmark collaborative approach ensures that before a matter even reaches the appellate phase, the firm’s appellate lawyers are working hand-in-hand with trial teams to persuasively frame and preserve issues for appeal. 

When a case reaches the appellate stage, regardless of jurisdiction, we enter the courtroom with vast collective experience arguing and winning cases in that very venue.
